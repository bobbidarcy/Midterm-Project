**My Academics**


[University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu)   
Currently I attend the University of Missouri.  
I will be finishing my freshman year with 72 credits.  
At Mizzou, I enjoy spending time studying in [_Ellis Library_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Library),   
Pictured below is the Memorial Union,  
I walk past it every day and when the weather is nice,  
I study right outside of it.

In Fall 2022, I will be transferring to [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu)  
and changing my major to _Management Information Systems_ as well as _Finance_.  
I have always wanted to move away from Missouri and I felt that this  
was my opportunity to do so.  


I love the outdoors so I am exciting to be moving to a place with lots of wildlife.  
Where I will be moving is part of The Palouse which is pictured below.
