# Career Goals 

My longterm career goals aren't completely  
mapped out yet, but I have an idea of what

    <h2> Credit Analyst
    </h2>
<p> A credit analyst helps to determine   
  the credit worthiness <br> of people and   
  helps to evaluate potential credit risks. <br>
  within a company. This is an interesting career
  path that I am<br> considering taking. This interested me
  when we began to evaluate<br> credit within the world.
