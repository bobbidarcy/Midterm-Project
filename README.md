**My Academics**


[University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu)   
Currently I attend the University of Missouri.  
I will be finishing my freshman year with 72 credits.  
At Mizzou, I enjoy spending time studying in [_Ellis Library_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Library),   
Pictured below is the Memorial Union,  
I walk past it every day and when the weather is nice,  
I study right outside of it.
