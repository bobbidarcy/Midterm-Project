# My Interests

Some of my interests and hobbies include:
* Yoga 
* Reading
* Spending time outdoors
* Caring for plants

## Yoga 

This activity gives me the opportunity to destress  
and helps me manage everything that is going  
on in life.  
My favorite yoga pose is [child's post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasana)

## Reading

Reading is something that I have always loved.  
As I grew up I would get lost in different books and genres.  
I had lost my passion for reading as my life became more hectic  
but I am trying to get back into the habit.  
My favorite book series is [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter)

One of my favorite quotes from the series is: 
>"Differences of habit and language are nothing  
at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open."
